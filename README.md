# macOS Virtual Machine
A ARM macOS Virtual Machine, using macOS 12's new Virtualization framework.  
I copied KhaosT's code from [here](https://gist.github.com/KhaosT/fb0499130bbfcb5754d2174e78cb68b9), all I did is change some path, add some entitlements and add a simple GUI.

### Requirements
- Apple Silicon Mac (running macOS 12)
- Xcode 13
- Apple Configurator 2
- macOS 12 IPSW (rename to ipsw.ipsw)
- a empty dmg image (This will be your system storage, rename to disk.dmg)

### First Time Setup

1. Clone this project  
2. Run this project (This project works on my Mac but might not run on yours)   
3. Quit the app when "Virtual Machine" window showed up, move ipsw.ipsw & disk.dmg into the app's container
4. Rerun this project  
5. Open Apple Configurator 2, if everything works, There should have a VirtualMac in DFU mode
6. Drag ipsw file into Apple Configurator 2, click Restore to install macOS 
7. When it's done, you should see a purple window greeting to you. Bon App√©tit!

Special thanks to [KhaosT](https://github.com/KhaosT), his code make this possible.
